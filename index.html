        <h1 class="grayHeader">Search Function is Unclear</h1>
        <p class="bodyTextGray">
          Our first task was to search for something on AP News and navigate to an article corresponding to that search.
          <br>
          <br><i class="fa-solid fa-stopwatch"></i> 18s
          <br><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> 80%
          <br><i class="fa-solid fa-brain"></i> --
          <br>
          <br>The search function proved to be a little unclear, as instead of searching
          as usual it provides a list of topics and stories pertaining to your search and
          you have to click one to find an article. The user was a little confused but quickly recovered.
          <br>Recommendation: change search to function as expected, if they wish to keep the
          “topics search” provide that as a drop-down option that is not automatically selected as
          it is a unfamiliar to most users.
        </p>

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h1 class="grayHeader">Mailing List Pop-Up</h1>
        <p class="bodyTextGray">
          Our second task was to join the mailing list/find the mailing list pop-up.
          <br>
          <br><i class="fa-solid fa-stopwatch"></i> 4s
          <br><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> 100%
          <br><i class="fa-solid fa-brain"></i> 100%
          <br>
          <br>
          The mailing list pop-up appears when you first browse the website and also at random (?).
          The user had it appear immediately after they clicked off an article. This may have just been luck however,
          as we were unable to find a dedicated place to join the mailing list and users would have to rely upon this pop-up
          to join.

        <h1 class="grayHeader center">Keyboard Navigation</h1>
        <p class="bodyTextGray blockText">
          Our third task was to navigate to another article using only the keyboard.
          This was by far our most difficult task and the user was unable to complete this without help.
          <br>
          <br><i class="fa-solid fa-stopwatch"></i> 1m 3s
          <br><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> 0%
          <br><i class="fa-solid fa-brain"></i> 50%
          <br>
          <br>
          While the user was able to recall the website well they were unable
          to navigate using only the keyboard without a hint. The options on this website are not great,
          and it is very frustrating to navigate without a mouse.
          <br>
          <br>
          Reccomendation: we reccomend that AP News take steps to improve accessibility with a keyboard,
          in our case if you press “Tab” instead of immediately beginning to tab through the website it selects the
          “enable accessibility” icon and you have to hit tab several more times to begin keyboard navigation. This was very
          confusing to our user, who expected it to begin tabbing through all the options. Additionally, adding other input,
          like the arrow keys, could improve navigation.

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h1 class="grayHeader">Sections Menu</h1>
        <p class="bodyTextGray">
          The next task was to use the ‘sections’ menu to navigate to another article.
          <br>
          <br><i class="fa-solid fa-stopwatch"></i> 4s
          <br><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> 100%
          <br><i class="fa-solid fa-brain"></i> 100%
          <br>
          <br>
          The user very quickly navigated to another article, commenting on how easy it was.
          This feature is very intuitive, and helpful when navigating through the website.
